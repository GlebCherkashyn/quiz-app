    // Your condition to check answer type was optional value of 'wrongAnswer', but it will always be unused for CorrectAnswerCell, thats why I think enum gives more context and is more expandable. In case if you need to add some other data to cell or some information about it's behaviour (example: some cells should block selection, some labels should have another font of color etc.)
